Color Eightball (or Rainbow Launcher) is an Unreal Tournament (1999) mutator that replaces the regular rocket launcher with a rocket launcher that shoots randomly colored balls with different effects. Effects include: freeze, fat explosion, redeemer, regular missile, and disintegrate. Available as a regular mutator and as Arena.

There are 5 random effects that will spawn out of the Color Eightball launcher:

Blue Projectile - This is a blue projectile that just does normal rocket damage.
Green Projectile - This will disintegrate the victim.
Gold Projectile - This will cause the victim to increase in fatness until the explode.
Grey Projectile - This will freeze the victim and leave an ice statue in place.
Red Projectile - This is a redeemer.


There is a menu setting to flag redeemer on and off.


Originally built by me (as Bog_Wraith) back in 2000, I released it GitHub in 2017. 

I have been enhancing and adding to it since. Follow along at
